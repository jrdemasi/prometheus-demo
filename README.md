# Prometheus Demo
A quick docker-compose setup to stand up prometheus, a node exporter, blackbox exporter with two sample endpoints, and Grafana with a dashboard for node exporter.  


Attempted to add blackbox dashboard, but it has import issues via auto provisioning in grafana.  [13659](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13659) is tested, though, so you can import it manually.
